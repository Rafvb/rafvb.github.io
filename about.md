It's nice that you've taken an interest in me! :)

### More Information

I've been a developer since 2005. Currently I'm working at [Cegeka](http://www.cegeka.com). I am interested in web development and app development (Windows and Windows Phone). I also like fiddeling with other programming languages.

I work in an [agile](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) fashion using [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)) and [XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming) practices. Focussing on clean, well testend and maintainable code is how I like to work. I've also given some trainings on these subjects. 

I've got a great wife and beautifull son. I let both of them take up most of my spare time. I also like running and playing guitar.
