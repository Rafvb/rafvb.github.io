## Preface
I've been practicing TDD for a while now. Along the way my view on how to practice TDD has shifted a lot.
Lately I've given some training sessions on TDD and refactoring, which allowed me to refine my views on what I think is doing TDD the 'right' way.
When I look around the internet I still see alot of people explaining TDD in a way that can be demotivating for someone 
who is new to the subject or can even be damaging to a project (I've experienced this hands on).

In this series I wanted to delve into what I consider good TDD.

## What we'll see
First we'll go back to basics and ask ourselves why we do TDD. We'll see what benefits good TDD can bring and explore some of the misconceptions.
Next we'll delve into the concept of mocking and why abuse of it can be damaging. 
Finally we'll wrap things up with a short look at the hexagonal architecture.
