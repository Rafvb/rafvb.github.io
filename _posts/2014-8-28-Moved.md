Like alot of bloggers before me, I've also moved away from [Wordpress](https://rafvb.wordpress.com/). The blog now runs on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as the blogging platform.

## Why?

The most important question is, why move?

For me, there where 2 reasons:

1. I like Wordpress, and found Wordpress.com handy to get started. I considered self hosting my Wordpress blog, but didn't feel like installing php or a sql server. I also found Worpress a bit too big for my blogging needs, and since I like to be in control of everything (my wife calls it: control-freak), I got lost in all the options.
2. It's fun to try new stuff :)

So, because I wanted to kick start my blog again, why not start from scratch!

## How?

I started out by doing everything on my own locally. After reading up on some other blogs, I thought that would take too much time to set everything up myself. That's when I found the [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repo.

Basically you can just fork it and start customising. I really love it's simplicity, so it serves as a really good starting point for a minimalistic blog. You can read the full tutorial of how to set it up at the Jekyll Now repo.

I'm also using [prose.io](http://prose.io) to edit the files. It works directly on my repo and has a built in Mardown editor (among other blogging features, such as draft posts and images support). Works very well on the go too. Great tool! 

So now I've gotten a minimalistic blog over which I've got full control and I can manage fully in the cloud.

So far I'm liking this! :)

## Next?

So, what can you expect to see on this bog?

I'm planning to do a series on building a maintainable Asp.Net MVC site. After that maybe I'll do some posts on Windows Phone development.

You can follow my blog if you'd like to be kept up-to-date. 

## Previous?

I've not migrated my old posts yet. Still looking for a good (= easy) way to convert them to the Markdown format. It's also not a top priority since, the old site will remain online.

And now, lets get blogging!
